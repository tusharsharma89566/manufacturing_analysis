# Manufacturing Analysis

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing manufacturing data, performing data exploration, and generating insights to support manufacturing process optimization. It is designed to help engineers, analysts, and decision-makers gain actionable information from production datasets.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for manufacturing datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Machine learning models for predictive maintenance, quality forecasting, and anomaly detection
- Automated reporting and dashboard generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Recommended: create and activate a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tusharsharma89566/manufacturing_analysis.git
   cd manufacturing_analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your manufacturing data (CSV, Excel, etc.) in the `data/` directory.
2. Use the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `notebooks/` or `src/` directories to analyze your data.
3. Outputs such as plots, reports, and models will be generated in the corresponding output folders.

Example (running a script):

```bash
python src/analyze_production.py --input data/production_data.csv
```
